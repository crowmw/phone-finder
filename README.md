# Phone finder

Application that searches for phone models and displays their specifications.

Please enter at least two characters in the search box to search for a phone model.

When the list of phones appears, you can click on a specific model to see details.

I used the debounce function because of not to flood the open API with unnecessary requests.

I know that the application lacks tests and error handling. But by design it was supposed to be just simple components.
